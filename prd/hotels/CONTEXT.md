## Current step

**2026-07-19 — Standard is now the default (season is optional).** Previously every price
needed a dated season, even the base rate (a `season` named `standard`). Reversed per the product
owner: `rate_rule.season_id` is now **nullable** — a season-less rate rule **is** the Standard
(base) rate. The resolver prefers a matched dated season's band and **falls back to the Standard
band** (`season_id = NULL`) when no season covers the stay or the season lacks a band; the
**`NO_SEASON` outcome is removed**. Unique index is now `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` so duplicate Standard
bands still collide. Migration `0019`; seed converts legacy `standard` seasons → season-less rate
rules and drops those season rows (171 season-less / 2 seasoned after re-seed). The rate-rule admin
form makes Season optional ("leave empty = Standard"); the list shows "Standard" for null. Golden
scenario S9 flipped from NO_SEASON-omitted to Standard-fallback-priced. Full stack: `packages/db`
(schema + migration + seed), `packages/shared` (rateRule `seasonId` nullable), `apps/api`
(resolver + specs), regenerated hooks, `apps/web` (form + columns + i18n), and these hotels PRD docs.

**2026-07-18 (later still) — JED-WFH/MAD-CIN season windows extended to cover
the full flight date range.** User report: searching hotels/creating a
package for a flight date like 2026-08-08 found no hotels, because
JED-WFH's `peak` season ended 2026-07-01 and MAD-CIN's only season ended
2026-05-01, while the seeded CGK<->JED/MED demo flights (`prd/flights/15-seed-data.md`
v1.2 + the 6-airline addition) run 2026-05-31 through 2026-10-26 — well past
both. Fixed by extending both to end 2027-01-01 (matching the Nusuk hotels'
full-year window already seeded that same day, see below), so every seeded
property now has season coverage for every seeded flight date. `packages/db/
src/seed.ts` is the only place this needed to change — no schema change.
`hotels.service.spec.ts`'s S9 (NO_SEASON) already used a 2027-02 date after
the Nusuk-hotel pass below, so it still passes unchanged.

**2026-07-18 (later same day) — 56 Nusuk-approved Makkah/Madinah hotels loaded from
`prd/hotel_list.md`; `property` gained 4 columns.** A user-supplied directory of
real Nusuk/Hajj-and-Umrah-approved hotels (name, city, star rating 3-5, a
"Quad Occupancy" USD price range, distance-to-landmark, one contact value)
was loaded into `property`/`room_type`/`season`/`rate_rule` via
`packages/db/src/seed.ts`. 2 of 41 source rows had no usable price ("Varies"
throughout) and were skipped, so 56 of 58 total seeded properties are Nusuk
data (JED-WFH/MAD-CIN are the original 2). Key decisions (all user-confirmed,
none inferred):
- **Price**: the source gives one range per hotel ("Quad Occupancy per
  night"); the **high end** of that range is used, converted from USD to
  **IDR** at the same USD->IDR rate already seeded for display conversion
  (16,300) — stored as the rate_rule's *native* currency, not USD + live FX.
- **Room types**: the source only supports Quad pricing, so `room_type` now
  gets 3 rows per Nusuk property — Double/Triple/Quad — with Triple at 80%
  and Double at 55% of the Quad amount, tiling occupancy 1-4 with no gaps
  (bands 1-2 / 3-3 / 4-4). Double/Triple prices are **derived, not sourced**.
- **Season**: one full-year `standard` window (2026-01-01 to 2027-01-01) per
  Nusuk property — the source gives a single flat rate with no seasonal
  breakdown, unlike JED-WFH's standard/peak split.
- **New `property` columns** (nullable, migration `0013`): `distance_meters`
  (int) + `distance_note` (text) for the source's inconsistent
  "< 100m" / "~2km (Shuttle)" / "150m (2 min walk)" distance strings, and
  `contact_phone` + `contact_email` (text, split from the source's single
  mixed phone-or-email column). Added to `packages/shared`'s
  `propertySchema`/`createPropertySchema`, `apps/api/src/hotel-properties/`,
  and the `catalog/properties` admin form + table columns + all 6 locales —
  full-stack, not backend-only (user's explicit choice over a
  backend-and-seed-only option).
- **New `Makkah` city** (`MKK`) added to the seed `cities` array — until now
  only `JED`/`MED` existed, but roughly half the Nusuk hotels are in Makkah.
- **A pre-existing golden scenario broke and was fixed**: `hotels.service
  .spec.ts`'s S9 (NO_SEASON) searched Madinah dates in June 2026 expecting 0
  results, which held when MAD-CIN was the only Madinah property (its lone
  season ends 2026-05-01) — with 18 more Madinah properties now carrying a
  full-year season, that date range is no longer outside every season. Fixed
  by moving the test to 2027-02, genuinely outside every seeded window.
- Full quality gates green (`typecheck` 5/5, `lint` 0 new, `test` 106
  API + 127 web, `db:seed` verified idempotent across 2 runs).
- `11-data-model.md`'s `property` table doc has been updated with the 4 new
  columns.

---

**2026-07-18 — hotel-domain `package` concept removed; `listing`+`property` merged.**
The domain's original `listing` spine (`kind = 'property' | 'package'`) modeled two
different sellable things: a hotel/lodging unit, and a self-contained,
season-total-priced multi-night deal with no flight attached. At the user's
request, the `package` concept is gone — this domain is lodging-only now.
`listing.kind` is repurposed into `property.type`, a lodging-type
classification (`hotel` | `apartment` | `house`), not a search-polymorphism
discriminant. Since `listing` and `property` are now 1:1 forever, they were
merged into a single `property` table (confirmed with the user — this removes
the indirection that only existed to support the property/package split):
`season`/`rate_rule` now FK to `property_code` (natural key) instead of a
ULID `listing_id`, `rate_rule.room_type_id` is `NOT NULL` (no more
nullable-for-packages), and the partial "no room type" unique index /
`NO_ROOM_TYPE` frontend sentinel are gone. This is **unrelated** to the
separate travel-packages domain's `flightHotelPackage` table (DB name
`travel_package`, flight+property bundle) — that table, its API, and its
admin/public UI were not touched.

Full change: DB schema + a 3-stage migration (`0008`–`0012`, staged to avoid
drizzle-kit's interactive rename-resolution prompt, which requires a TTY this
environment doesn't have), `packages/db/src/seed.ts`, the Zod contracts in
`packages/shared`, the `apps/api/src/hotel-packages/` module deleted outright,
`apps/api/src/hotels/`+`hotel-properties/`+`hotel-seasons/`+`hotel-rate-rules/`
simplified, `apps/web/src/features/hotel-packages/` deleted, the hotel-search
property/package toggle and `hotel-properties` admin form's new `type` field,
and i18n across all 6 locales. `pnpm typecheck`/`lint`/`test` all green
(106 API tests, 127 web tests). `11-data-model.md` was rewritten to the new
6-table shape; `00-overview.md`, `01-glossary.md`, `13-resolver-and-search.md`,
`14-scenarios.md`, `15-seed-data.md`, `30-frontend.md`, and
`32-frontend-steps.md` still describe the **original build including the now-
removed package concept** — treat them as historical record of that build, not
current spec; `11-data-model.md` + this file are authoritative going forward.

Prior work below is **committed** (as of `5e0b3a6`, 2026-07-14).

**Latest pass (`5e0b3a6`): City reference entity, Travel Packages domain,
hotel-search UI unification, catalog/reference rename.** Highlights that
touch this domain specifically:
- Hotel search's bespoke "umrah/pilgrimage" visual identity (see
  `31-design.md`, now marked superseded) was removed and replaced with the
  app's default design system, as described below — this landed in the same
  commit as the other changes, not a separate pass.
- **New City reference-data entity** (`apps/api/src/cities/`, admin UI under
  a "Reference Data" sidebar section) now backs the `destination` field on
  both Property and Package admin forms — `destination` changed from free
  text to a `ComboboxFormField` populated by `useListCities()` /
  `toCityNameOptions()`, so hotel listings' destinations are constrained to
  known cities rather than arbitrary strings.
- **`catalog/currencies` and `catalog/fx-rates` routes renamed to
  `reference/currencies` and `reference/fx-rates`**, joining the new
  `reference/cities` screen. **`catalog/properties`, `catalog/packages`,
  `catalog/room-types`, `catalog/seasons`, `catalog/rate-rules` were *not*
  renamed** — they remain under `(protected)/@admin/catalog/*`. The "Catalog
  Admin" section in the sidebar and this doc now spans both `catalog/*` (the
  5 listing-scoped entities) and `reference/*` (currency, fx-rate, city —
  cross-domain reference data reused by flights too).
- The shared `Combobox` primitive was rebuilt on real shadcn `Command`
  (fixing a pointer-events-inherited-from-Dialog bug — see
  `[[feedback_use_shadcn_components]]`), which the new city comboboxes on
  the Property/Package forms depend on.
- A `/code-review` pass across the hotel catalog and search flows found and
  fixed additional issues on top of the ones logged below (see `git show
  5e0b3a6` for the full diff if a specific fix needs to be traced).

**Hotel-search UI unification** (part of the same commit): the user noticed
Search Flights and Search Hotels looked like two different products and
asked for one consistent design system; decision was to unify hotel search
onto the app's default semantic tokens and shadcn `Card`/`Badge`/`Button` —
the same primitives `flight-search` already used correctly — rather than
keep two brands. Removed: `globals.css`'s `.hotel-search-theme`/`.hs-card`/
`.hs-cta`/`.hs-mizan`/`.hs-reveal` block, the unused `fontHotelDisplay`/
`fontHotelBody` exports in `fonts.ts` (these were never actually wired into
`layout.tsx`, so the brief's serif display font had silently never been
loading). All `hotel-search/*` components now match `flight-search`'s exact
patterns (bare form, `Card`-based results/detail, `text-primary` price,
`text-muted-foreground` secondary text). No business logic or data-fetching
changed — styling only.

**Search (Steps 3–8 backend, F1–F5 frontend) is done, browser-verified, and
committed.** A second build pass then added **full admin CRUD for the
catalog** (all 7 manageable entities: currency, fx_rate, property, package,
room_type, season, rate_rule) at explicit user request — "I've checked the
hotel feature is just for searching... I need to also be able to manage all
the data for hotel feature." This mirrors flights' Schedule Admin exactly:
`apps/api/src/hotel-{currencies,fx-rates,properties,packages,room-types,
seasons,rate-rules}/` (controller/service/dto/module each), 7 matching
`apps/web/src/features/hotel-*` admin screens under a "Catalog Admin"
sidebar section (admin-only — no `@user` counterpart, matching `schedule/*`
precedent; routes now split across `catalog/*` and `reference/*` per
above), full i18n across all 6 locales. `EntityDataTable`/`useCrudFeedback`
were generalized with a `namespace` parameter to serve both sections.

**Found and fixed a real, pre-existing, app-wide bug during this pass**: 
`apps/api/src/main.ts`'s `app.enableCors()` never set `methods`, and
`@fastify/cors` defaults to `GET,HEAD,POST` only — every PATCH/DELETE
endpoint in the *entire app* (not just hotels) silently failed in the browser
after a passing OPTIONS preflight. Fixed with an explicit `methods` array.
This had been broken for every existing admin screen (airports, airlines,
flights, mct-rules, interline-agreements, flight-marketing) the whole time;
none of it was hotels-specific.

**`pnpm check:dupes` went over threshold (3.28%, gate is 2.0%)** once the 7
new admin screens landed — they (and 5 pre-existing schedule-admin screens)
shared two near-identical blocks: the create/update/delete `useMutation`
wiring, and the Dialog/ConfirmDialog JSX shell. Fixed by extracting shared
primitives and applying them to **all 13** admin screens (not just the 7 new
ones — partial extraction wouldn't have cleared the gate, and the pattern
was already past the rule-of-three before this session):
`crudMutationOptions()` in `use-crud-feedback.ts` (collapses the 3x
`{ onSuccess: onSuccess(key, after), onError }` boilerplate into one call),
`EntityFormDialog` + `EntityDeleteConfirm` in `components/shared/` (collapse
the Dialog/ConfirmDialog shells), and `actionsColumn()` in
`components/shared/actions-column.tsx` (collapses the repeated
`RowActionsCell` actions-column `cell` definition across every `columns.tsx`
except `flights` (has an extra "view" action) and
`interline-agreements` (delete-only), which keep bespoke `RowActionsCell`
usage since their shape doesn't match the plain edit+delete pattern.
Duplication dropped to 1.97%, under gate.

All repo-root quality gates are green again (`typecheck`, `lint`, `test`
94+127, `check:dupes` 1.97%, `check:backbone`, `check:instructions`). This
Catalog Admin work, and the later City/Travel-Packages/rename/UI-unification
pass, are all **committed** — see "Current step" above for the latest state.

---

Below this line: the original search-feature build log (Steps 3–8, F1–F5),
committed and unchanged since.

Backend: all 8 tables + 2 enums live in
`packages/db/src/schema/app.ts`, migration `0003_powerful_killer_shrike.sql` +
a hand-written custom migration `0004_hotels_season_no_overlap.sql` (Drizzle
has no schema-builder API for Postgres `EXCLUDE` constraints — this is the
`drizzle-kit generate --custom` escape hatch, not a hand-edit of generated
output). Seed data (3 currencies, 3 fx rates, L1/L2/L3 listings) is in
`packages/db/src/seed.ts`, verified idempotent (two `pnpm db:seed` runs,
stable row counts). `apps/api/src/hotels/` has `money.ts`/`resolver.ts` (pure,
unit-tested), `hotels.service.ts`/`controller.ts`/`dto.ts`/`module.ts`, all
12 golden scenarios green in `hotels.service.spec.ts` against live Postgres,
plus a `hotels-invariants.spec.ts` for the cross-entity checks (94/94 tests
green, typecheck/lint clean). Contracts added to `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
(`hotelSearchQuerySchema`, `hotelSearchResultSchema`, etc.), `pnpm generate:api`
run and committed-ready (`apps/api/openapi.json` + generated web hooks).

Frontend: `apps/web/src/features/hotel-search/` (form, results, refine rail,
orchestrator, page-content wrapper), pages at both
`(protected)/@admin/hotels/page.tsx` and `@user/hotels/page.tsx`, tokens in
`globals.css` (`.hotel-search-theme`, `.hs-mizan`, `.hs-card`, `.hs-reveal`),
fonts added to `apps/web/src/app/fonts.ts` (Amiri + Plus Jakarta Sans), i18n
`hotelSearch` keys added to all 6 locale files. **Found and fixed a real bug
during browser verification**: the search form and refine rail originally
committed every keystroke straight to the URL (matching the "URL is the
state" requirement too literally), which re-rendered the Server Component
mid-type and clobbered in-progress input — fixed by buffering form/price-bound
edits in local component state and only navigating on Search-click / blur.
Verified end-to-end with a real Playwright script (registered a user, ran a
Jeddah search — 2 results, property showing `SAR 400.00 × 3` → `SAR 1,200.00`,
package showing a flat `SAR 6,750.00` with `$1,800.00 · converted` beneath, no
per-night line; a Madinah search — 1 result, `Madinah Central Inn`; URL
correctly carried all query params on both). One hydration warning appeared
(`caret-color: transparent` injected onto inputs) — confirmed pre-existing/
environmental by reproducing it against the *unmodified* flights `/search`
page too, not something this change introduced.

**Step F4** (`hotels/[id]` detail page, `PriceBreakdown`, mailto stub CTA):
since there's no dedicated get-by-id endpoint (matches the PRD's actual API
surface — only `GET /hotels/search` was ever defined), the detail route
carries the same search inputs (destination/checkIn/checkOut/occupancy/
currency) as query params from the "View details" link and re-runs
`useSearchHotels`, finding the matching row by `listingId` client-side. A
missing/excluded listing (bad id, or NO_SEASON/NO_BAND for those exact dates)
shows a directive not-found message, never a crash — verified with a garbage
ULID in the URL. `PriceBreakdown` mirrors the API's actual `breakdown` shape
exactly (no season/band labels — the contract never carried them, so this
renders what's really returned rather than an aspirational richer shape).
"Request this" is a genuine `mailto:` to `siteConfig.contact.supportEmail`,
never a POST.

**Step F5** (motion/a11y/responsive): reduced-motion verified with
`page.emulateMedia({reducedMotion:'reduce'})` — `.hs-reveal` cards render at
`opacity:1`/`animationName:none` immediately, confirming the CSS's structural
guarantee (the fade-rise keyframe only exists inside
`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`, so there's no "turn off
animation" branch to get wrong — reduced-motion is the unstyled default).
Mobile verified at 360px width — no horizontal overflow; the refine rail
simply stacks above the results in a single column rather than the design
brief's bottom-sheet pattern (a deliberate scope simplification for this
build, not a bug — noting it explicitly here so it doesn't get "fixed" by
accident later without a decision to build the bottom sheet). Repo-wide a11y
lint (Biome) found zero new warnings across any hotel-search file.

**Two real bugs found and fixed during browser verification** (both are why
this took actual browser-driving, not just typecheck/tests):
1. The search form and refine rail originally committed every keystroke
   straight to the URL (over-literal reading of "URL is the state"), which
   re-rendered the Server Component mid-type and clobbered in-progress
   input — fixed by buffering edits in local component state, committing on
   Search-click / blur only.
2. The shadcn `Button`'s default variant sets its background via a
   `.btn-primary-gradient` CSS class that uses `!important`, so the inline
   `style={{backgroundColor: 'var(--hs-haram-green)'}}` silently lost —
   fixed with a dedicated `.hs-cta` class (also `!important`) instead of
   inline styles for the two haram-green CTAs.
A third bug (a copy duplication — "SAR 400.00 × 3 3 nights", double-counting
the night count because `t('durationNights', {count})` already embeds the
number) was caught the same way and fixed in `price-breakdown.tsx`.

All repo-root quality gates green: `pnpm typecheck` (5/5 packages),
`pnpm lint` (zero new warnings — the ~34 that show are 100% pre-existing,
none touch any hotel file), `pnpm test` (94 API + 127 web, all passing),
`pnpm check:dupes` (1.57% repo-wide, under the 2% gate — one 2-copy clone
exists between `hotel-detail.tsx` and `hotel-search-results.tsx`'s card
header block, left alone per the rule-of-three: two copies don't warrant
extraction yet), `pnpm check:backbone` (90 paths verified).

## Entity table (current, as of 2026-07-19: 7 entities, 7 tables, 0 derived)

`listing` and `package` no longer exist — see "Current step" above. This supersedes the
historical "8 entities" table this section used to carry (kept in the domain's build history
via git, not restated here).

**2026-07-19**: Room Type and Season became **global reference data** (no `property_code`); the
per-property date window that selects a season moved to the new `season_window` table.

| # | Entity              | Table                 | Key            | Admin CRUD                            | Notes |
|---|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | Property            | `property`            | property code  | `catalog/properties` | Spine + property fields merged into one table. `type` ∈ {hotel, apartment, house}. `destination` is a city-name combobox backed by the City entity. |
| 2 | Room Type           | `room_type`           | ULID           | `catalog/room-types` | **Global reference catalog**, unique by name. `max_occupancy` is the category default. |
| 3 | Season              | `season`              | ULID           | `catalog/seasons` | **Global reference catalog** of season labels, unique by name. Standard = null (no row). |
| 4 | Season Window       | `season_window`       | ULID           | `catalog/season-windows` | Per-property dated window → global season. Non-overlap per property. |
| 5 | Rate Rule           | `rate_rule`           | ULID           | `catalog/rate-rules` | (property, global season, global room type, occupancy band) → price in a currency. `room_type_id` is always set. |
| 6 | Currency            | `currency`            | ISO-4217 code  | `reference/currencies` | Reference table, shared with flights. |
| 7 | FX Rate             | `fx_rate`             | ULID           | `reference/fx-rates` | (base, quote) → rate. For display conversion only. |

All 5 catalog entities have full create/edit/delete admin screens under
`(protected)/@admin/catalog/*`, and the two shared reference entities under
`(protected)/@admin/reference/*` (currency, fx-rate — reference data shared with other domains).
The City entity (dependency of the Property form) lives at `reference/cities`; see
`apps/api/src/cities/`.

## Confirmed decisions

- Scope: **search-only**, lodging properties (hotel/apartment/house).
- Pricing source: **static, seeded in our DB**. No external API.
- Pricing behaviors required day one: **date-range/nightly, per-occupancy,
  seasonal/tiered, multi-currency**. All four.
- Money = integer minor units + ISO currency. ULID/natural keys, never UUID.
- Price = **nightly × nights**, always.
- FX is display-side conversion only; rate rules store a native currency each.
- Frontend: **Next.js 16 App Router** (existing `apps/web`, no scaffold), read-only client
  over `GET /hotels/search` via the generated `useSearchHotels()` hook, URL = state, all
  money math server-side. Visual direction: **umrah/pilgrimage-
  grounded** (limestone + haram-green + gold hairline; terracotta banned).
  Signature = the "mizan" price-line. See 30/31/32.
- **Built inside this monorepo, not a standalone app**: DB tables go in the existing
  `packages/db/src/schema/app.ts` (copy the `post` pattern); API is
  `apps/api/src/hotels/` (copy `apps/api/src/posts/`); contracts are Zod schemas in the
  existing `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, reusing `currencyCodeSchema`/`ulidSchema`; IDs are
  `createId()` from `@repo/db` (never a bare `ulid()`, never UUID).
- **Gated behind auth, like flights** — search lives under both
  `(protected)/@admin/hotels` and `@user/hotels` (same permission-slot pattern flights uses),
  not a public sign-in-free page. No auth guard code to write — the repo's global `AuthGuard`
  covers it by default.
- **Full i18n, like flights** — every user-facing string via `useTranslations`, translated
  into all 6 locales (en/es/fr/ar/bn/zh).
- Money is **integer minor units + currency**, intentionally stricter than flights' looser
  `numeric(10,2)` price column — rationale: FX conversion math needs to avoid float/decimal
  rounding drift that a single-currency domain (flights) never had to worry about.

## Definition of done: met

All backend steps (3–8) and frontend steps (F1–F5) per `20-steps.md` /
`32-frontend-steps.md` are complete and committed. The Catalog Admin build
pass (full CRUD for all 7 manageable entities) is also complete,
quality-gated, and committed, along with the later City-entity/reference-
rename/UI-unification pass — nothing from this domain is currently
uncommitted. Note: **this domain has no `prd/` folder entry of its own for
the City or Travel Packages work** — City reference data and the Travel
Packages domain landed in the same commit as hotels UI unification but
belong to their own (currently undocumented) domains; `prd/README.md` and
`backbone.yml`'s `prd.domains` map still only list `flights` and `hotels`.
